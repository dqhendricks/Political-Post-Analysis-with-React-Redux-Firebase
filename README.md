Personal project analyzing facebook political post data. Data is scraped and processed server side using node.js and facebook graph API, then processed and saved each night into a homemade PHP database API I created on another server. The result is displayed in a single page React, Redux, Semantic UI App served using node.js and express.

I used to use a Firebase database for this app, but I hit my free download limit trying to do some of the more advance analytical processing after the scrape. This is why I created a PHP REST API on another server to take it's place. You can find this app as well in another repo.

I have stopped nightly scraping since facebook apps are limited to a certain amount of scraping per active user. This scraping could go on indefinitely with enough users. The data collected for just these four pages for a single day can reach millions of records as well, so your datastore would need some horsepower to complete the final analysis without erroring out. I had to make several changes to the analysis code that make the queries less performant, but use less memory, just to process a single day's worth of data on the shared PHP server I used without erroring.
